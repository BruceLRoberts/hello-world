Saying hello to the world of GitHub.

Hello, world. My name is Bruce Roberts, and I enjoy solving problems. Coding is a way of doing exactly that from the comfort of a chair, so here I am. I have experience with Java and C++ through my education, with plans to continue learning, and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
